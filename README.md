BerlinNight Colorscheme

Forked from the amazing [lunarvim](https://github.com/LunarVim/lunar.vim) colorscheme to customize it further to my needs.
I felt the need to visually differentiate between functions and methods, then between params and variables, so I started experimenting with changing highlight groups through autocommands and recently I thought it would be a good idea to have something more of a formal version of what was local only to my neovim config. So far there are only JS/TS/JSX/TSX-web-dev-specific color tweaks where I saw fit.

## Installation

```lua
'waikoo/berlinnight.vim'
